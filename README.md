# Smart Helmet for Miners

A smart helmet that leverages IoT technology to enhance the safety of mine workers by detecting environmental and health risks. The system utilizes sensors such as pulse, gas, impact, and radio frequency (RF) transmitters/receivers to detect hazards and send emergency alerts in real time.

## Features

1. **Gas Sensor**  
   - Monitors methane gas levels inside the mine.  
   - Generates an emergency alert when the gas level exceeds a safe threshold, ensuring timely evacuation.

2. **Pulse Sensor**  
   - Continuously tracks the miner's pulse rate.  
   - Sends a signal to the group head in case of an abnormal pulse reading, indicating a potential health issue.

3. **Impact Sensor**  
   - Detects any impact or fall on the helmet.  
   - If the force exceeds a safe limit, it triggers an alert for potential rockfalls or accidents in the vicinity.

4. **Emergency Push Button**  
   - Can be manually activated by the miner in situations where other sensors may not detect the emergency.  
   - Immediately generates an emergency alert to notify the control room.

5. **Arduino Integration**  
   - Serves as the central controller, integrating all sensor inputs and managing data flow.

6. **RF Transmitter and Receiver**  
   - Ensures reliable communication by transmitting and receiving signals in the harsh mining environment.

## How It Works

- **Data Collection**: The sensors continuously monitor environmental conditions and the miner’s health.
- **Alert System**: Alerts are generated when any sensor detects unsafe conditions or when the emergency button is pressed.
- **Communication**: The RF module ensures that signals can be transmitted to the control center, even in the challenging underground conditions.

## System Architecture

1. **IoT Sensors**: Collect data on environmental conditions and miner’s health.
2. **Arduino**: Integrates data from sensors and triggers alerts when thresholds are crossed.
3. **RF Module**: Transmits the emergency signals to the control room for action.
4. **Control Center**: Receives real-time alerts and notifications to respond quickly to emergency situations.

## Future Improvements

- **Cloud Integration**: Implement cloud storage for storing long-term data on miners’ health and environmental conditions, which could be analyzed for insights.
- **Mobile App**: Build a companion app for real-time monitoring by supervisors on mobile devices.
- **GPS Tracking**: Integrate GPS to track the exact location of miners, enhancing safety and emergency response times.
